# Enhanced Heart Disease Risk Classification Model

## Overview
This project reimagines heart disease risk prediction by transforming raw medical data into actionable insights. It employs advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to achieve reliable and meaningful predictions of heart disease risk.

## Dataset Overview and Preprocessing

The dataset underwent rigorous cleaning and transformation processes:
- **Outlier Removal**: Ensured data integrity by eliminating anomalous entries.
- **Feature Normalization**: Standardized key features such as blood pressure, weight, and height for consistent scaling.
- **Advanced Clustering**: K-Modes clustering was applied to segregate patterns by gender, unveiling distinct health profiles for males and females.

## Feature Engineering and Target Encoding

The dataset was enriched with calculated and categorized metrics:
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: Derived and grouped into risk-specific categories.
- **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)**: Computed and categorized for better representation.
- **Age Segmentation**: Grouped into cohorts reflecting varying risk levels.
- **Multi-Class Target Encoding**: Expanded prediction scope into five categories:
  - Low Risk
  - Coronary Artery Disease
  - Hypertension-Related Disease
  - Diabetes-Related Disease
  - Multiple Risk Factors

These enhancements provided a robust foundation for model training and better interpretability.

## Data Visualization

Visualization was pivotal in understanding trends and correlations within the dataset. Tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib were employed to generate insightful visuals:
- **Heatmaps**: Highlighted correlations among risk factors.
- **Bar Charts**: Illustrated the prevalence of various disease categories.
- **ROC Curves**: Assessed and compared model performance visually.

## Model Training

Multiple advanced machine learning algorithms were trained and optimized:
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
  - XGBoost
- **Optimization Techniques**:
  - Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV for optimal performance.

Random Forest stood out as the best-performing model after rigorous evaluations.

## Evaluation Metrics

A range of evaluation metrics ensured the reliability and accuracy of predictions:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Measure of true positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Sensitivity of the model.
- **F1 Score**: Balance between precision and recall.
- **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**: Insight into the modelâ€™s ability to differentiate between classes.

Comprehensive confusion matrices and classification reports validated the effectiveness of the models.
